    <h2>Unavailability of good Quality of Seeds</h2>
    <p> Seeds are the basic input or raw material for the farmers to grow crops. But there is a lack of availability of the good quality of seeds in the market. And if the good quality seeds are available, they are so expensive that the poor and marginal farmers are not able to afford.Due to this, farmers are bound to use the traditional seeds which less productive and yields fewer crops. Most of the certified seeds manufacturers in India are private companies.The government should either tie-up with these companies or provide direct subsidies to the farmers so that they can afford the best quality of seeds for production.</p>
<br>
    <h2>Lack of Modern Equipment</h2>
    <p> Even in 2020, the majority of Indian farmers use traditional tools for agriculture such as plough, sickle, etc. This leads to the wastage of energy and manpower and less yield per capita labour force.Only little use of the machine is seen in irrigation, harvesting and transportation. There are two reasons why farmers are not using modern equipment. First, they are not aware, and second, they can't afford such equipment.The second problem is, even if a farmer can afford the equipment but there is the unavailability of electricity 24*7 in the village areas.There is an urgent need to modernise the agricultural operations of the country. Many state governments have started a scheme from which farmers can take modern equipment for rent at a low price. This way they don't have to pay the full sum of amount and they will also get the machines.This is just the start of mechanising agriculture in India. In recent years there was a huge increase in sales of tractors, power tillers, etc. But India cannot achieve its full agricultural productivity until the whole agriculture system is mechanised.</p>
<br>
    <h2>Poor Irrigation facilities </h2>
    <p> Irrigation is one of the essential steps for a crop to grow perfectly. But do you know that only one-third area of the total land in India has proper irrigation facility available?India has the second-largest irrigated land in the world, but still, India faces this problem.Punjab has the highest percentage area of irrigated land in the country of about 98% irrigated land availability, followed by Haryana. The reason for good irrigation facilities is the availability of water throughout the year from the rivers and dam. This helps the farmers to conduct agricultural operations timely. But scenario all over the country is not the same. In central India, rivers don't carry water throughout the year. Due to this, farmers have to depend on the monsoon water for irrigation which is very uncertain.</p>
<br>
     <h2>Small and Fragmented Holdings of land</h2>
     <p>This is one of the major reason why Indian farmers are not competent. Because, most of the poor farmers have a very small amount of land and that too in a fragmented manner. And according to data, the average size of holding of land per farmers is decreasing every year. It means the situation is getting even worse.This problem becomes more serious in densely populated states with less farming land. Only 1.6% of total land holdings belong to the category of large holding that too by the rich farmers.It becomes difficult for a farmer to irrigate and harvest in fragmented lands because a lot of time is wasted in moving the resources from one field to another.The main reason for this kind of system is the inheritance law of India. When a person dies, the land belonging to him is distributed among his sons, but this distribution does not insure entailment of a consolidated land. And due to this, most of the farmers in India have fragmented lands.</p>
<br>  
    <h2>Dealing with local traders and middleman </h2>
       <p> It is a problem a farmer faces at the end of all agricultural activity. This is why we have also mentioned it in the end. But don't judge the importance of this problem by its position.We often see in the news that farmers thrown their crops on roads just because no one purchased it.Due to the absence of mandi houses and proper market places, farmers are not able to sell their crops and get a reasonable price. In this situation, they have to look for a middleman and local traders for business.These middlemen don't provide a reasonable price for their crops, and hence farmers are bound to either sell crops at a lower price or just throw at the roads.</p>
<br>
    <h2>Lack of Storage facilities </h2>
    <p> In the absence of market place, the local traders dominate the market and exploitation of farmers takes place. These middlemen are not only creating a problem for farmers but also for consumers because they ultimately sell the crops at a very high price after purchasing it from farmers.The situation of poor farmers is even worse. They are forced to sell their crops at whatever price is offered to them.Going through these entire problems, how can we expect from our farmers to produce good crops. Instead, we should ask our government to provide the facilities that they deserve.</p>
